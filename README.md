Essential Kitchen Necessities

| Kitchen Items | Notes | 
|:---|:---|
| Kitchen Knife | A very good kitchen knife - can **look at Ikea**. The another good one is **Zwilling** (Look on Shoppee) but more expensive. Aim for <mark>RM50-100</mark>. You will use this A LOT if you cook a lot. Make it good. | 
| Frying Pan | Preferably can do induction - If can do induction it can do everything. Long lasting will be cast iron / stainless steel but needs some skill to use. Even cheaper ones are good. If you wanna go for non-stick, go for **Tefal** (Shoppee) or **Ikea**. Aim for ==RM40-100== here too. |
| Saucepan | You will want to get a relatively good one - you will be cooking all your Maggi and Indomie in this thing, so it will be one of your most used items. Get one like Tefal or what if you can afford it, but my rule of thumb is go stainless steel for this one. It will last longer and you will thank me. (My mom has been using her saucepan for like 20 years and it's probably the best one for cooking Maggi with.)
| Silicone Spatula | These are good for like everything. I use them for desserts and making fried rice and sambal also got. I suggest you get two. One for dessers one for savoury stuff. Generally these are between ==RM5-10 each==. Just get a no brand one from a baking store. | 
| Wooden Spatula | These are very good for if you use non-stick. You can get these for dirt cheap, like between ==RM5-7== maybe RM10 at most each. You only usually need like 1. But make sure to oil it every now and then with cutting board oil. Got mine from **Ikea**. | 
| Bench Scraper | This thing is quite useful when you're dicing something then you want to pick it up. Your knife can work, sure but this is wider. I bought mine from **Daiso**. ==RM5.90==. |
| Cutting board | The plastic ones are fine and are easier to clean, but apparently they give out microplastics if you care about that. Microplastics are kind of unavoidable anywhere nowadays anyway. Wooden ones are better, but also more high maintenance - you need to oil it with cutting board oil. Plastic ones are around like ==RM5-15==. Wooden ones can range from the cheapo ones for like RM10 all the way to the high end ones that are like RM500. Ikea has some good ones between ==RM29 (bamboo) to RM100== (The fancy butcher blocks). Just aim for between that if you want wooden. |
