# Essential Kitchen Necessities

| Kitchen Items | Notes | Suggested Prices |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| Kitchen Knife | A very good kitchen knife - can **look at Ikea**. The another good one is **Zwilling** (Look on Shoppee) but more expensive. Aim for <mark>RM40-100</mark>. You will use this A LOT if you cook a lot. Make it good. | RM40-100 |
| Frying Pan | Preferably can do induction - If can do induction it can do everything. Long lasting will be cast iron / stainless steel but needs some skill to use. Even cheaper ones are good. If you wanna go for non-stick, go for **Tefal** (Shoppee) or **Ikea**. Aim for **RM40-100** here too. **MAKE SURE TO TRY GET ONE WITH A STEEL HANDLE WHERE POSSIBLE OR GOOD PLASTIC HANDLE NOT CRAPPY PLASTIC HANDLE.** | RM40-100 |
| Saucepan | You will want to get a relatively good one - you will be cooking all your Maggi and Indomie in this thing, so it will be one of your most used items. Get one like Tefal or what if you can afford it, but my rule of thumb is go stainless steel for this one. It will last longer and you will thank me. (My mom has been using her saucepan for like 20 years and it's probably the best one for cooking Maggi with.) **MAKE SURE TO TRY GET ONE WITH A STEEL HANDLE WHERE POSSIBLE OR GOOD PLASTIC HANDLE NOT CRAPPY PLASTIC HANDLE.** | RM40-100 |
| Silicone Spatula | These are good for like everything. I use them for desserts and making fried rice and sambal also got. I suggest you get two. One for dessers one for savoury stuff. Generally these are between **RM5-10 each**. Just get a no brand one from a baking store. | RM5-10 |
| Wooden Spatula | These are very good for if you use non-stick. You can get these for dirt cheap, like between **RM5-7** maybe RM10 at most each. You only usually need like 1. But make sure to oil it every now and then with cutting board oil. Got mine from **Ikea**. | RM5-7 |
| Bench Scraper | This thing is quite useful when you're dicing something then you want to pick it up. Your knife can work, sure but this is wider. I bought mine from **Daiso**. RM5.90. | RM5.90-15 |
| Cutting board | The plastic ones are fine and are easier to clean, but apparently they give out microplastics if you care about that. Microplastics are kind of unavoidable anywhere nowadays anyway. Wooden ones are better, but also more high maintenance - you need to oil it with cutting board oil. Plastic ones are around like RM5-15. Wooden ones can range from the cheapo ones for like RM10 all the way to the high end ones that are like RM500. Ikea has some good ones between RM29 (bamboo) to RM100 (The fancy butcher blocks). Just aim for between that if you want wooden. | RM5-15 (plastic) RM29-100 (wooden) |
| Measuring Spoons | Optional: If you want to bake, but it does help a lot with other stuff. | RM5-10 | 
| Ice makers / Ice moulds | **I KNOW YOU WANT THESE IMA**. We got ours from Mr DIY. They have a good selection there. | RM5-15 |
| Can Opener | Most people don't need one until you really need one then suddenly you don't have one and then you're screwed. There's this cheap one that I got called a **P38 or P51 Can Opener**. The both designs are about the same, but the P51 is larger. You can get these in packs of like 3-4 on Shoppee I think for pretty cheap. If you can't find that then just get anything that's cheap. | RM5-15 |
| Rice Cooker | If you don't have one of these in Malaysia then you're screwed. These can get pretty cheap or pretty expensive. Get one from a reputable brand that won't make your house catch fire like a good brand like **Panasonic** or something. I think even Mr DIY has some that are decent, but I haven't tried before. | RM60-100 |
| Plates and Bowls | By far the cheapest ones I've found that are decent are from Ikea, but **Mr DIY** has a good selection as well. Go for ones that are like between RM2-5 per plate/bowl. | RM2-5 | 
| Cups and Glasses | Like the plates and bowls, just go for cheap. If you're starting out with low budget, can just get a good melamine one or plastic one, but get a**t least one porcelain mug for hot drinks** or since you have your tumbler that works too. RM4-10 each. | RM4-10 |
| Mixing Bowls | Just for food prep and mixing. Can just get one of those steel "dog bowl" mixing bowls from **Mr DIY** or some plastic ones. The dog bowl ones last longer but plastic is easier to clean and handle. | RM5-15 | 
| Strainer / Colander | **You need this for cooking instant noodles** that you boil and mix. Other than that, can use for straining pasta and washing sayur / fruits. RM5-15. If you get a big one then you can use it for everything. | RM5-15 | 
| Storage Containers | You WILL have leftover food or prep ingredients from cooking, so you need to get yourself a good set of containers for this. I got mine at IKEA like a set of 17 for like RM20 or something. You can get fancier with the Ikea 365 ones if you want also but for a start you can choose to get the cheaper one or just both also can. The GOAT is tupperware lah but this one only if you have generational wealth or inheritance. | RM15-50 |

## Recommended but not required:
| Kitchen Items | Notes | Suggested Prices |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| Electric Kettle | If you don't have a cuckoo or coway or whatever, this is what you will use to make hot drinks. If you have to boil water using a pot everytime you want to make tea, you will hate yourself. Can check Mr DIY for this. I'm not too sure the price though. | RM40-80? | 
| Steel pot | For soups and bulk cooking. Usually you can get away with just using the saucepan, but sometimes you might need to cook a lot more than just like 2-3 portions of Maggi. This is what that is for. | RM20-80 |
| Cuckoo or Coway water filter | I would **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** getting one of these because it's literally a gamechanger. You no need to boil water using kettle to drink clean water or lug heavy mineral water bottles to your apartment. Generally you can get these for like RM45++ a month. Just get the rental, no need to buy. Comes with free maintenance usually. | RM45++/month |
| Airtight container | You will want one of these for rice. | RM10-15 | 
| Food Clips | If you don't have these, you will need to tie stuff using the packaging or use rubber bands. Ew. Still can but yikes. I just use the IKEA ones. Daiso and Mr. DIY also have, but **IKEA is the OG.**| RM5-10 per pack | 
| Used cooking oil container (steel) | It's not needed, but if you don't have one, you have to discard your oil, and **YOU CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT THROW OIL IN THE SINK!!! YOU WILL CLOG YOUR PIPES!!!** If you don't have one of these, Daiso sells an oil solidifying tablet that can solidify the oil and then you can throw it in the garbage bin. Using one of these, you can reuse the oil, but don't reuse it if it's already black. | RM10-15 | 

# Essential Pantry Items
#### Note: For these pantry items, get the cheapest ones. Brand names are generally not worth unless you really want to treat yourself. Even then the taste is about the same. Except for kicap manis, Kecap Bango is THE GOAT.
| Pantry Items | Notes | Suggested Prices |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| Rice | Just get the cheapest one. Personally I buy in bulk 5kg, but if you can't lift that alone, they also sell 2kg bags. | RM10-25 per bag |
| Cooking Oil | Just get 1kg/1L bottles and then when finished just buy more. Personally, we have one bottle of frying oil and one bottle of canola oil (healthier for sauteeing stuff). The frying oil goes back into the used oil container so that we don't have to buy more (wasting money that you can use to gamble on Pokemon Cards) | RM7 (frying) RM12 (canola) | 
| Kicap | Make sure to get one kicap masin and one kicap manis. These will be used to add salt and umami to rice so you don't have to eat it bland. | RM5-10/bottle | 
| Oyster Sauce | Less salt, more umami. Basically natural MSG, essential for Chinese / Malay cooking. | RM5-10 per bottle | 
| Salt | I usually buy one grinder for salt, then I refill it with this brand called **Salt Sense**. They sell sea salt / pink salt for bulk and cheap. I buy a refill of this like once every 6 months. | RM10-15 (Grinder) RM2-3 (Salt Sense) | 
| Pepper | I buy a grinder, like the salt, then just get the cheapest black peppercorn refill bag I can find and refill it with that. | RM10-15 (grinder) RM5-6 (black peppercorns) |
